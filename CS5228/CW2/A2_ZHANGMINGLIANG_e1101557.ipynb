    "#### Calculating the RSS Scores of a Node and a Split (nothing for you to do here!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from lecture that a criterion score is necessary in order to decide which split to make at a node. The criterion score can be interpreted as measuring the quality (or \"purity\") of the response variable within a node. In lecture, we introduced the use of the Gini index and entropy for measuring the purity of a node. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we instead focus on regression trees, which are similar but slightly easier to implement. The quality measure used here is the *Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)*, or the sum of squared differences between the response variables of samples in a node, and the mean response variable in the node. Formally, the RSS score of a node is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RSS_{node} = \\sum_{i\\in R_{node}} (y_i - \\mu_{R_{node}})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ is the response variable for sample $i$, $R_{node}$ is the set of sample indices at the node, and $\\mu_{R_{node}}$ is the mean of the response variable for samples in $R_{node}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analogously, the RSS score of a split is defined as summing the RSS score of the nodes resulting from the split:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$RSS_{split} = \\sum_{k=1}^K\\sum_{i\\in R_k} (y_i - \\mu_{R_k})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is the number of child nodes (here $K=2$ since all splits are binary splits), $R_k$ is the set of sample indices in child node $k$, and $\\mu_{R_k}$ is the mean of the response values in $R_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition behind the RSS criterion is analogous to that of Gini index / entropy: the RSS at a node measures the amount of variation in a node, so if we find a split that achieves a low RSS, this means we have effectively separated the high values of the response variable from the low values of the response variable, which is a good split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these are very basic arithmetic operations, we give you the two methods `calc_rss_score_node` and `calc_rss_score_split` for free. Have a look at both methods to convince yourself that these methods implement the formulas given above. Again, since we consider only binary splits, method `calc_rss_score_split` simplifies to calling `calc_rss_score_node` twice on both child nodes and summing up both scores."

Note that the method returns not the values themselves but the indices of the values. By giving you this method, we can ensure that everyone should get the exact same result, as well as that the results will match with the Decision Tree implementation of scikit-learn. For example, `create_split()` puts all samples `<=` then the threshold into the left child node (and all others into the right child node). However, there would be no principle difference to put them in the right child node (and all others into the left child node). It's purely a convention to ensure consistency. Again, have a good look at `create_split()` to understand its inputs, inner workings, and output."

    "### 4.3 Hyperparameter Tuning (3 Points)\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of the different models in off-the-shelf implementations vary quite a bit, but of course, we used the only default parameters of each implementation which might or might not be good for our dataset and task. In practice, you would perform hyperparameter tuning for all or at least most models. However, this is unnecessarily since the tuning process is very similar for each model. So we do it only for one model: **GradientBoostingRegressor**, which is very similar to the boosting approach discussed in lecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Use [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html)! It automatically performs k-fold cross-validation (by default: k=5, which is fine) for all specified combinations of hyperparameter values. With [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html), finding the best model (i.e., the model with the best hyperparameter models) should only require only very few lines of code!\n",
    "* For all other arguments of [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) (other than the model and the parameter grid), you can use the defaults.\n",
    "* [`GradientBoostingRegressor`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.html) with (`base_estimator=DecisionTreeRegressor()`) provides a whole range of hyperparameters. Pick **2-3 hyperparameters** to tune the model (any choice of hyperparameters and grid values is fine; feel free to pick them based on your preference).\n",
    "* Setting a large grid (e.g. more than 10 parameter combinations) may cause `GridSearchCV` to run slowly."
